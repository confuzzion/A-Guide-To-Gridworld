Assuming that you've followed the directions in how to set up gridworld you should have the following:
 - A folder that you have made which has:
  - info and META-INF, which were both extracted from gridworld.jar and all the info inside was unedited
  - a Runner/Tester java file which has the appropriate import statements
    - eg "import info.gridworld.actor.ActorWorld;","import info.gridworld.actor.Bug;", 
          "import info.gridworld.actor.Actor;", etc...)
    - you only need to import the files that you are extending and using, such as ActorWorld which you 
      use to actually show the grid with "<nameOfWorldObjectYouCreated>.show", Actor and Bug, which you 
      need to create the bugs that show up on screen. (for more help, look at my "Runner.java")
  Your new bug extensions should have the import statements that it uses as well, such as 
  "import info.gridworld.actor.Actor" and "import info.gridworld.Bug."
  
To actually run gridworld after you have all of the above set up, use the terminal

 - change your directory in your terminal to where the folder is (the folder that has all the above stuff)
 - compile only the files you're testing, such as the Runner/Tester and the Modified Bug thing.
  - make sure that your Tester/Runner has created the appropriate Bug object, such as if you made a ZBug
    you need to make sure that your tester has made a new ZBug object, not just the bug object, and placed
    it into the world
 - the commands are as followed
  - "javac <nameOfFileYouWantToCompile>.java"
  - remember to compile all the files you are testing, not including the ones inside of the INFO, and 
    META-INF, but the ones you are using (Runner.java(the tester) and ZBug.java(your own version of Bug)
 - then java <name of compiled file>, which should make it run
  - on linux you just need to type "java <name of the file>", not "java <name of the file>.class" 
    dunno if this also applies to Macs, they're pretty similar OSs
    
good luck, go ask questions if you're stuck, just make sure to explain context to the questions.
